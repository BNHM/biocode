Issues with loading biocode data from Excel files: 

biocode table:
--------------

need to put 0 in seq_num field
need to put 0 in tissues field
fill out ScientificName field (concatenate genus, species, subspecies. eventually remove this field altogether?)
fill out InstitutionCode with MBIO
fill out CatalogNumberNumeric (with numeric part of bnhm_id)
have to fill in EnteredBy (ie, Chris Meyer)
have to fill in DateFirstEntered (ie, 2006-10-19  --  date format is important)
have to fill in Collector_List field (concatenated collectors)

higher taxonomy is missing
not all names are in the biocode_species table; have to write a script to find these

fields from collecting_event are missing; have to write script to add (and make sure not to overwrite values that DO exist)
  for above: wrote 2 scripts; one deals with collectors separately as they are a different problem
  /home/joyceg/tmp7        <- have to move from here
 

"" around fields -- had to run sql to fix



biocode_species table:
----------------------

new names aren't listed here

I added about 50 species by hand (took 1/2 an hour and was faster than writing a script)
Chris has to add another 50 species by hand



biocode_tissue table:
---------------------

first try:

tissue file arrived as a .txt with pc-style line breaks; had to run a sed command to fix:
sed -e 's/\r/\n/g' tissue_upload.txt > new_tissue_upload.txt

loaded one tissue record, got 4 warnings:

mysql> source load.sql;
Query OK, 1 row affected, 4 warnings (0.08 sec)
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 4

mysql> show warnings;
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                                                   |
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1265 | Data truncated for column 'tissue_num' at row 1                           |
| Warning | 1265 | Data truncated for column 'year' at row 1                                 |
| Warning | 1264 | Data truncated; out of range for column 'month' at row 1                  |
| Warning | 1262 | Row 1 was truncated; it contained more data than there were input columns |
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


second try:

run sed again to get line breaks

date is in wrong format. needs to be like this: 2006-03-12
ran this to fix since all the dates were the same:
sed -e 's/10\/17\/06/2006-10-17/g' tissues.txt > tissues_fixed.txt


data in now:

"" around fields -- had to run sql to fix


new tissuetypes not in table (and not in pull-down lists) -- have to add 
  after removing "", or are we doing away with the tissue type table?

have to add "Sampled by"

<pre>
2007-04-06 insect data

add: seq_num, CatalogNumberNumeric, bnhm_id
DateFirstEntered is 2007-10-17  (??) -- changed to 2007-04-06 (or should it be 2006-10-17?)

April 2008

Issues with loading biocode data from Excel file: 


double quotes (around some text fields from Excel; used sed to get rid of them)
lat/longs with too many integers after the decimal point
one decimallatitude field had this in it: #VALUE!
IndividualCount empty in many (most?) cases
3 collectors names in database but spelled differently
taxonomy: wrong higher taxonomy in specimen record
taxonomy: missing higher taxonomy in species record
lifestage: values that aren't from our list of accepted values
sex/caste: values that aren't from our list of accepted values
